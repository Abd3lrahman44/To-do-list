# To-Do List Project

## Project Description
To-Do List Project is an interactive To-Do list started by Dr. Susan Rodger in the Duke University's course: Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTNL, and CSS. The Project was initialized
with some pre-written JS, HTML, and CSS and was modified by me on CodePen as part of the Programming Excercise.

## Modifications By Me
-Implemented the "Add" Button and gave it funcionality and styled with CSS.

-Added and styled the "Input Field" where the task is entered and gave it a placeholder.

-Debugged and fixed "Input Field" as after adding a task, it stayed in the input field. Now it is removed and replaced with placeholder: "Enter next task".

-Changed "Checkmark" button background color to green, and "Crossmark" background color to red.

-Added Interactive Change when the check button is pressed, a line cross is drawn over the task and background color is changed to gray, and only then can it be removed from list.

-Added an "About" button that shows who the "Author" is and a "Clear" button to remove the text again.

-Changed some of the styling with CSS.
